# Tasklets

Tasklets are little tasks or todo items that take between 15 minutes 
to 1 hour to complete.

If a tasklet takes longer than an hour, it should be decomposed
into two or more tasks.  Notice: decomposed, not "refactored."
Refactoring comes later, when building checklists.

The whole point is to chop things down into their smallest 
logical linear piece.
