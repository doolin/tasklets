# Tasklets

[![Build Status](https://doolin.semaphoreci.com/badges/tasklets/branches/master.svg?style=shields)](https://doolin.semaphoreci.com/projects/tasklets)

Tasklets is a long term, intermittently developed ongoing project
for achieving the following:

- Toy Rails project suitable for tinkering and experimenting.
- Practicing mastery with habitual and daily incremental progress.
- Exploring the nature of how things get done, how those things
  are described, and how they can be measured.
- Staying in practice with current employer's SDLC process

## Near term roadmap

The near term goal is getting enough functionality to be useful
for bootstrapping.

- Get API token auth working in parallel with Devise
- Implement backup and restore via S3

There is no particular timeline.

## History

The project started in January 2011 as part of teaching myself
Ruby on Rails.

Shortly after starting the project, it became apparent
that there would need to be quite a lot of javascript necessary
to achieve what I was looking for, the Javascript would be painful
and ugly, and I didn't have the time or inclination to pursue it
at that time. Since then, the Javascript world has advanced
tremendously, especially with the rise of Single Page Applications.
At some point it will be time to revisit the front end.

In the meantime, the Ruby and the Rails
code has been kept up to date with respect to versions and best practice.

Update 2020-08-29: I've started adding detailed comments and links
to the source code to help serve as a reference implementation.
Normally, _I never add such comments to production code!_.

## More reading on habits and mastery

Mastery is path, not a destination, and requires framing activity
on that path as outcome-independent play and learning. Here are a
couple of links:

- - George Leonard: "Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term
    Fulfillment."
- BJ Fogg: http://www.bjfogg.com/ and http://tinyhabits.com/

There is much, much more available, the above two links are enough
to get started.
